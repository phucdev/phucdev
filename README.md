### Hi there, I'm Phuc üëã

I'm a master's student in Computer Science at Humboldt University of Berlin, currently awaiting the results of my thesis titled **"Cross-lingual Transfer of Pre-Trained Language Models to Vietnamese"**.

For the past 6 years, I have been working as a student assistant in the [Speech and Language Technology Group](https://github.com/DFKI-NLP) at the [German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI)](https://dfki.de/web), focusing on Natural Language Processing (NLP) ‚Äì especially **Information Extraction**. During my time at the DFKI I wrote my bachelor thesis on weak supervision for event extraction. Most recently I have been working on **Biomedical Relation Extraction** with **Large Language Models (LLMs)** using the **LangChain** framework.

### üìò My Master‚Äôs Thesis

I recently submitted my Master‚Äôs thesis titled **"Cross-lingual transfer of Pre-Trained Language Models to Vietnamese"**.  
In this work I explored cross-lingual transfer techniques for adapting pre-trained language models to Vietnamese, focusing on tokenizer replacement and efficient initialization strategies.

### üéì My Bachelor‚Äôs Thesis & Projects

For my Bachelor‚Äôs thesis titled "Investigating Weak Supervision for the Extraction of Mobility Relations and Events in German Text", 
I explored weak supervision techniques for event extraction. In particular, I worked with [Snorkel](https://github.com/snorkel-team/snorkel), a framework for programmatically generating training data through labeling functions based on heuristics.  
This work was conducted at the [Speech and Language Technology Lab](https://github.com/DFKI-NLP), where I contributed to ongoing research efforts and related open-source projects. These include::

- üîß [**eventx**](https://github.com/DFKI-NLP/eventx): Implementation of joint classification of events and arguments  
- üîç [**wsee**](https://github.com/DFKI-NLP/wsee): Codebase developed as part of my thesis to investigate weak supervision for extracting mobility-related events and relations  
- üìä [**MobIE Dataset**](https://github.com/DFKI-NLP/MobIE): A dataset of mobility-related named entity and n-ary relation annotations  
- üìÑ [Published paper @ KONVENS 2021](https://aclanthology.org/2021.konvens-1.22/): Hennig, L., Truong, P. T., & Gabryszak, A. (2021).
